It's gameplay is directly influenced by classics like Doom, Quake and Half-Life.   The vector graphics and impossible geometry of the levels offer the two main points of departure from these original masterpieces of the genre.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1051840/extras/Vector_Graphics.png?t=1732719208\" /><br>Paradox Vector imagines if vector graphics were still popular when the first-person shooter genre got started.  In Paradox Vector you can witness a different kind of retro shooter.  As Chris McMullen of Gamespew put it: “Remember the heady days of the first-person on-foot wireframe shooter? No, me neither, but it hasn’t stopped Paradox Vector from revisiting a genre that never existed.”<br><br>Inspired by arcade games from the early 1980s like Tailgunner, Battlezone, and even the original Star Wars game, Paradox Vector takes this abandoned style, and brings it up to date.  <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1051840/extras/Impossible_Geometry.png?t=1732719208\" /><br>The impossible art of M.C. Escher along with the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, have had a big influence on Paradox Vector.  This is not a puzzle game, but an action game set in a puzzling environment. Hallways appear to go one way but actually go another, enemies may attack from angles you might not expect, and navigating the levels may require you to think outside of the box.<br><br>Don't think it's going to be easy though!  The ancient alien stronghold you are exploring is not abandoned.  The Ancient Ones and their Bio-Mechanical Servitors will foil your every effort while you unearth the secrets of the mysterious, eldritch citadel!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1051840/extras/Open_World.png?t=1732719208\" /><br>Following in the footsteps of games like Metroid Prime, Paradox Vector does not limit players to a simple series of levels, but allows you to explore an open environment, retracing steps as needed.  Some weapons and items will allow you to unlock secrets and upgrades, thus rewarding those who are curious and persistent.  Don't let the minimalistic graphics fool you, there is a lot to be discovered in this puzzling and challenging adventure.<br><br><strong>About AMD Graphics Cards:</strong><br>It looks like AMD cards are not really compatible with the line draw commands used in Paradox Vector, and users may experience a very low frame rate.  I am not 100% sure that AMD cards are the issue, but so far there are several reports that point to this being the most likely cause of the issue.  It may be that there is a setting that could help resolve the issue, but so far nothing has improved the situation.

The content in these packs are exactly the same, so if you already have one of these packs, you don't have to purchase the other!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>This expansion pack is designed to bring your Time Fantasy world into the future! The FUTURE FANTASY collection is based around two themes that integrate together: the modern city and the sci-fi world of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThis set includes 25+ new tilesets: everything you need to make a futuristic space station, complete with computer terminals and science equipment. A machine factory with moving conveyer belts, or a damp junkyard with concrete pipes and rusted cars, are perfect locations for dungeons. And of course a future setting isn't complete without a dark cyberpunk city. A more modern city is included too, with roads, highways, and modern-style houses for a suburban town. Modern interiors, with kitchen appliances, TVs, computer desks and more.\r\n\r\nThe collection includes over 50 character sprites, ranging from sci fi soldiers and mechanics to scientists and cyborgs to city police and urban punks. Four new hero characters have fully-animated side-view battlers!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n* Over 50 new character sprites!\r\n* 12 Modern tilesets! Towns and cities with interior and exterior, even a junkyard.\r\n* 12 Sci Fi tilesets! Space station, science lab, machine factory, and a cyberpunk city.\r\n* 4 new animated Side-View Battlers for heroes.\r\n* Animated object sprites: flashing computer screens, moving conveyor belts, cars and treasure chests.\r\n* Fully compatible with previous Time Fantasy style graphics!\r\n* For use with RPG Maker MV or the engine of your choice\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n\r\nThe included &quot;military&quot; character sets were originally released in the base Time Fantasy character pack. \r\nThey are included here as bonus sprites because they fit with the theme of this expansion.\r\n\r\nTerms of Use:\r\n\r\n* This pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.\r\n* OK to be used in Commercial projects\r\n* Contents can be edited\r\n* OK for use in games with gore\r\n* OK for use in adult-rated games",

Russia has done the same on the east coast of Greenland. Petroleum (10% of the world's reverse), gas, aluminum, rare earth elements...this part of the world has become strategically crucial and considering the antagonistic nature of the presidents of these two superpowers, the risk of conflagration is extremely high! Moreover, a worried Greenland wants independence from its controlling nation, the Kingdom of Denmark, and the restrictive laws of its environmental program.

Armed soldiers are patrolling the facilities and will shoot you on site; there is also an army of corrupted cybernetic killer robots hunting for you. Your goal is simple: find a way to escape Mars alive. You will have to use your arsenal of weapons to fend off heavily equipped soldiers, as well as the cybernetic killer robots. You will also have your trusty weaponized rover to guide you across the red planet. The Mars landscape is 4x4 miles, so have fun exploring.

From outside, Hotel Tutwin seems abandoned and empty, but wait... It's up and running? The characters you will meet are a strange bunch, but don't let them fool you. The world at Hotel Tutwin is a balanced ecosystem that has yet to be disrupted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPenni can choose between three male love interests, all of which have stories hidden in branches other than their main one. This means you can’t learn everything about one character by only playing the path leading to their happy ending. And it’s not like the story is made of happy endings either. In fact, only about one third of the endings are good. So if you’re looking for an easy love story without death or hardship, don’t look here!",

Purchase and equip unique and dangerous upgrades from the shop, and send your enemies some torpedoes (or lasers). Subs are falling from the sky and it’s up to you to destroy them. Put your reflexes to the test, using tight yet simple controls to dodge missiles, collect ammo and rack up kills. Verse a range of enemies and bosses and aim for highscore greatness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UPGRADES AND UNLOCKS GALORE</h2>Fit your sub with powerful upgrades, causing chaos in the water and sky. With 22+ stackable items to purchase, turn your sub into the ultimate killing machine.
