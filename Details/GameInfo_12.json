            "detailed_description": "Basketball is more than coaching, if you want your favorite team to succeed you will also have to oversee the recruitment of new players and manage your arena to secure new sources of funding for your team. <strong>PBM23</strong> lets you be the coach as well as the General Manager of any professional team around the world.<br><br>You can choose from 82 domestic leagues, including 10 women’s leagues, from 60 different countries across Europe, America, Asia and Oceania. With more than 2000 teams and 50 000 players it is not hard to see why PBM23 is truly a global basketball management game. Overall, including national and continental cups, you’ll have access to more than <strong> 160 playable competitions</strong>.<br><br>Once your reputation as a coach is established you might be offered a job as a head coach of a national team. International basketball is now more competitive than ever. Will you be up to the task of taking your national team to the top of your continent and then the world?<br><br>The user interface has been redesigned, with a complete overhaul of the player page that now features updated statistics and records as well as highlighted player capabilities by profile.<br><br><strong>New customisable 3D arenas</strong> are coming to <strong>PBM23</strong> with enhanced lighting effects for a more realistic look. Pro Basketball Manager has never looked so good - make your arena bigger, more modern, more unique, make it shine and get the crowd cheering. The perfect setting for a successful season!<br>The crowd will now react  to on court events making the games <strong>more dynamic than ever! </strong><br><br>All players in the game now feature detailed statistics covering their career. You will be able to look at past and present performances from your favourite players.<br><br>The editor has also been improved to include more features for a fully customisable gaming experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LICENSES</h2>The following leagues are officially licensed in PBM2023 with <strong>official names and photos of their players and teams</strong>:<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1875310/extras/steam_small.png?t=1700845289\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COACHING </h2>Coaching is not just asking a player to setup a specific play at a specific time. A successful coach has a set of unique plays that can decide the fate of a game when it matters the most, when the game is on the line! In PBM23 you <strong>can create your own plays</strong> and call them during the games to take your opponent off-guard. Don’t call the same plays too often though, as your opponent will adapt and try to outsmart you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> STATISTICS </h2>Be it individual players or teams, you have a whole range of statistics at your fingertips which allow you to manage your progress. You can thus check on your players’ performances (past and present), evaluate your own career, or even look back through the archives of the games of any team featured in PBM23.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1875310/extras/Gif_n1.gif?t=1700845289\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> SCOUTING, TRAINING, FINANCES </h2>Through our in-depth scouting system, you can <strong>send your scouts around the world</strong> to be on the lookout for the next best players to make it to the top. Train your players collectively, but also individually to get the best results. Improve your club's finances by improving your arena to generate extra revenue.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> GAME SIMULATION </h2><strong>3D mode</strong>: Follow the on-court action, making tactical changes on the fly and assigning your own plays to a player. <br><strong>2D mode</strong>: If you prefer, you can also follow the game in 2D.<br><strong>Text mode</strong>: You can also follow the game through a series of text messages that will detail the action on the court.<br>If you cannot wait any longer for the result, you can skip a quarter or even the entire game for an immediate result.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1875310/extras/Gif_n2.gif?t=1700845289\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> FEATURES </h2>In Pro Basketball Manager 2023 we have implemented <strong>a new user interface</strong>. All the information will now be only a few clicks away! The new player page will make it easier to access key information.<br>We also have the new customisable 3D arenas, coming in two different sizes and looks. They now look better than ever with enhanced lighting effects!<br>This year you will have the added benefit of the home crowd reacting to the game’s events.

            "about_the_game": "Basketball is more than coaching, if you want your favorite team to succeed you will also have to oversee the recruitment of new players and manage your arena to secure new sources of funding for your team. <strong>PBM23</strong> lets you be the coach as well as the General Manager of any professional team around the world.<br><br>You can choose from 82 domestic leagues, including 10 women’s leagues, from 60 different countries across Europe, America, Asia and Oceania. With more than 2000 teams and 50 000 players it is not hard to see why PBM23 is truly a global basketball management game. Overall, including national and continental cups, you’ll have access to more than <strong> 160 playable competitions</strong>.<br><br>Once your reputation as a coach is established you might be offered a job as a head coach of a national team. International basketball is now more competitive than ever. Will you be up to the task of taking your national team to the top of your continent and then the world?<br><br>The user interface has been redesigned, with a complete overhaul of the player page that now features updated statistics and records as well as highlighted player capabilities by profile.<br><br><strong>New customisable 3D arenas</strong> are coming to <strong>PBM23</strong> with enhanced lighting effects for a more realistic look. Pro Basketball Manager has never looked so good - make your arena bigger, more modern, more unique, make it shine and get the crowd cheering. The perfect setting for a successful season!<br>The crowd will now react  to on court events making the games <strong>more dynamic than ever! </strong><br><br>All players in the game now feature detailed statistics covering their career. You will be able to look at past and present performances from your favourite players.<br><br>The editor has also been improved to include more features for a fully customisable gaming experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LICENSES</h2>The following leagues are officially licensed in PBM2023 with <strong>official names and photos of their players and teams</strong>:<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1875310/extras/steam_small.png?t=1700845289\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COACHING </h2>Coaching is not just asking a player to setup a specific play at a specific time. A successful coach has a set of unique plays that can decide the fate of a game when it matters the most, when the game is on the line! In PBM23 you <strong>can create your own plays</strong> and call them during the games to take your opponent off-guard. Don’t call the same plays too often though, as your opponent will adapt and try to outsmart you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> STATISTICS </h2>Be it individual players or teams, you have a whole range of statistics at your fingertips which allow you to manage your progress. You can thus check on your players’ performances (past and present), evaluate your own career, or even look back through the archives of the games of any team featured in PBM23.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1875310/extras/Gif_n1.gif?t=1700845289\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> SCOUTING, TRAINING, FINANCES </h2>Through our in-depth scouting system, you can <strong>send your scouts around the world</strong> to be on the lookout for the next best players to make it to the top. Train your players collectively, but also individually to get the best results. Improve your club's finances by improving your arena to generate extra revenue.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> GAME SIMULATION </h2><strong>3D mode</strong>: Follow the on-court action, making tactical changes on the fly and assigning your own plays to a player. <br><strong>2D mode</strong>: If you prefer, you can also follow the game in 2D.<br><strong>Text mode</strong>: You can also follow the game through a series of text messages that will detail the action on the court.<br>If you cannot wait any longer for the result, you can skip a quarter or even the entire game for an immediate result.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1875310/extras/Gif_n2.gif?t=1700845289\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> FEATURES </h2>In Pro Basketball Manager 2023 we have implemented <strong>a new user interface</strong>.

You have to survive, rebuild civilization and, if possible, regain control over the Earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClassic RTS in sci-fi setting:<br />\r\n- manage your units<br />\r\n- build bases<br />\r\n- explore the planet, look for and mine various resources, hunt wild animals<br />\r\n- fight and interact with other players<br />\r\n- develop economy and diplomacy<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the beginning of the game, you, along with other beginners, will be thrown onto one of the uninhabited planets. After reaching a certain economic development and surviving in competition with other players, you will have the opportunity to build your own space fleet and start exploring space and colonizing other planets. The goal of the game is to regain and maintain control over the Earth. The one who owns the Earth is considered the leader of the rating. If the Earth has no owner, the leader is the one whose planet is closest to the Earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike just RTS, in which the PvP session is designed for a small and finite number of players and the map is available only to the participants of the session, and the session itself lasts only an hour or two. Periphery Online is MMORTS, it is one huge and open universe for all players, one endless PvP session. Wars here can last several months of real time. When you exit the game, the gameplay does not stop, your colonies continue to live and evolve in real time on the server. For example, you can log into the game in the morning, give orders, then log in in the evening, by which time everything will have been built, resources have been collected, the fence has been repaired, etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe closer a planet is to Earth, the higher the competition. In addition, some of the resources are not renewable. Therefore, in order to supply the central regions and, as a result, for a successful game, it is also recommended to colonize planets and build colonies somewhere on the periphery. In case you don't really like the constant PvP battles or you like exploration, the universe is quite large and there are places to hide and develop quietly. You can fly away from the center and explore space and quietly build your galactic empire there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf at first minutes it seems too hardcore, don't be alarmed, the maps in the game are quite large, and there is a built-in wiki.

You have to survive, rebuild civilization and, if possible, regain control over the Earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClassic RTS in sci-fi setting:<br />\r\n- manage your units<br />\r\n- build bases<br />\r\n- explore the planet, look for and mine various resources, hunt wild animals<br />\r\n- fight and interact with other players<br />\r\n- develop economy and diplomacy<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the beginning of the game, you, along with other beginners, will be thrown onto one of the uninhabited planets. After reaching a certain economic development and surviving in competition with other players, you will have the opportunity to build your own space fleet and start exploring space and colonizing other planets. The goal of the game is to regain and maintain control over the Earth. The one who owns the Earth is considered the leader of the rating. If the Earth has no owner, the leader is the one whose planet is closest to the Earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike just RTS, in which the PvP session is designed for a small and finite number of players and the map is available only to the participants of the session, and the session itself lasts only an hour or two. Periphery Online is MMORTS, it is one huge and open universe for all players, one endless PvP session. Wars here can last several months of real time. When you exit the game, the gameplay does not stop, your colonies continue to live and evolve in real time on the server. For example, you can log into the game in the morning, give orders, then log in in the evening, by which time everything will have been built, resources have been collected, the fence has been repaired, etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe closer a planet is to Earth, the higher the competition. In addition, some of the resources are not renewable. Therefore, in order to supply the central regions and, as a result, for a successful game, it is also recommended to colonize planets and build colonies somewhere on the periphery. In case you don't really like the constant PvP battles or you like exploration, the universe is quite large and there are places to hide and develop quietly. You can fly away from the center and explore space and quietly build your galactic empire there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf at first minutes it seems too hardcore, don't be alarmed, the maps in the game are quite large, and there is a built-in wiki. As you progress, you will have enough time before encountering other players to get comfortable with the controls, learn the rules, and build your starting base and defenses.",

Originally built as Vauclain Compound locomotives, which used the steam twice to propel the locomotive before exhausting out the chimney, the class was reboilered and converted to Simple Expansion locomotives in 1912-13. Later, from 1923, the lass was renumbered between 200 and V215 (several locos were scrapped prior to renumbering). The first to be scrapped was V513 in June 1924, with V499 (now V200) being the last in 1930.<br><br>V499, being the pattern loco, arrived and ran with several differences from the rest of the class. The most prominent was the Baldwin builders plates mounted on the smokeboxes sides and smokebox door; the smokebox door plate being removed when converted to feature the more typical 'dart' arrangement on Victorian Railways locomotives, along with several other changes early in life. It's tender also featured rolled disc wheels, and a 'straight' flare at the top that was typical of Baldwin locomotives. When first introduced to service V499 wore Baldwin Green with gold lining, polished steelwork and brasswork, Russian Iron boiler, and Mineral Brown running boards, roof, and tender top.
