One minute you're sucking up specters, the next you're sucking up to your bosses, chasing that promotion. <br>Have you got what it takes to be the best at putting pests to rest?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827610/extras/02_dont_suck.gif?t=1729502298\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Don’t Suck… Well, Actually Do</h2>Exercise that fighting spirit, since every specter you snag and every resident you rescue is added to your client’s bill at the end of the job.

Yeah, so do we, and we grew up on their stretchy squishy gross-out laughs. Our love for them spills over into the game like so much ectoplasm.

To top it off, the entire adventure is backed by music from the award-winning Will Morton (<i>Grand Theft Auto</i> series).",

For you, it’s just another day in the office.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Exorcise restaurants, offices and other buildings.<br></li><li>Use a plasma blaster, your trusty vacuum pack and a whole range of supernatural items.<br></li><li>Save your mentor's soul or she'll spend eternity as a spook (voted “Least Preferred Fate” in Ghost Hunter Monthly).<br></li><li>So many ghosts.<br></li><li>A madcap story written by IGF nominee Xalavier Nelson Jr<br></li><li>Drop in/drop out couch co-op, as your mentor appears to lend a hand!<br></li><li>Stunning cartoon-quality artwork inspired by 90’s favourites like Ren &amp; Stimpy.<br></li><li>Actually, maybe too many ghosts?<br></li><li>Featuring original music by the award-winning Will Morton (Grand Theft Auto series).<br></li><li>Twitch and Mixer integration allows viewers to help or hinder the streamer.<br></li><li>Seriously, can someone please get rid of all of these ghosts?</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827610/extras/01_familiar_haunts.gif?t=1729502298\" /><br><br><strong>Please note that Dead End Job supports mouse &amp; keyboard controls for single player, but couch co-op requires at least one player to use a controller. </strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Familiar Haunts</h2>You take on the role of Hector Plasm, a worker at Ghoul-B-Gone – ‘the Number One experts in paranormal pest control’ – as you’re tasked with heading to haunted offices, restaurants, and other everyday buildings before freeing them of unwanted guests. One minute you're sucking up specters, the next you're sucking up to your bosses, chasing that promotion. <br>Have you got what it takes to be the best at putting pests to rest?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827610/extras/02_dont_suck.gif?t=1729502298\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Don’t Suck… Well, Actually Do</h2>Exercise that fighting spirit, since every specter you snag and every resident you rescue is added to your client’s bill at the end of the job. Haunted by the ghost of your mentor, quite literally, you must learn the ropes and to save her soul before she’s forced to spend eternity as a spook (voted “Least Preferred Fate” in Ghost Hunter Monthly).<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827610/extras/03_kindred_spirits.gif?t=1729502298\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Kindred Spirits</h2>Play alone or bust ghosts with a buddy in drop in / drop out co-op that works seamlessly within the main adventure. Plus you can play to an audience with Twitch and Mixer interactivity that allows viewers to help or hinder your assault on the afterlife.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827610/extras/04_ghost_writer.gif?t=1729502298\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ghost Writer</h2>Do you love 90's cartoons? Yeah, so do we, and we grew up on their stretchy squishy gross-out laughs. Our love for them spills over into the game like so much ectoplasm. See every nose hair in wacky, vibrant art that brings everyday items to life as screwball spooks to suck up. To top it off, the entire adventure is backed by music from the award-winning Will Morton (<i>Grand Theft Auto</i> series).",

Each monitor uses approx. 32 bytes of traffic per second in/out.  To put that in perspective, you can poll a server 32,000 times before it uses even 1 MB in/out. By comparison, just watching a single second (1 second) of 1080p video on Youtube uses roughly 100,000 times more bandwidth than each monitor you have running. <br><br><strong> Why would I use this? </strong> <br>This is a great way to decide &quot;Is it me?&quot; by doing the following:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Set up Monitor #1 to be your router (ie, 192.168.0.1 / 10.0.0.1 or such).<br></li><li>Set up Monitor #2 to be your next-up hop of your ISP (do a tracert to determine this).<br></li><li>Set up Monitor #3 to be something typically very reliable.  I suggest 8.8.8.8 or google . com<br></li><li>Set up Monitor #4 to be an online game server you typically play on.</li></ul><br>Now let's say you're getting drops from your favorite game server, or experiencing lag.  Just by looking at the Monitor Ping app, you can now confirm some very important information. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Is it between your PC and your router (such as bad wifi?).  Well, just check Graph #1 and that will answer it.  No packetloss + steady latency = not a wifi problem.<br></li><li>Is it your connection between your home and your ISP such as a cable model issue?  Well, cheeck Graph #2 and that will answer it.<br></li><li>Is it your ISP backbone?  Well, Graph #3 will help answer that.<br></li><li>Is it the actual game server's network?

The original Dungeon Travelers game takes place in a separate world from the others, drawing characters instead from the fan-beloved world of the PS2 anime classic <i><strong>To Heart 2</strong></i>.<br><br><strong>Prepare at the Guild!</strong><br>Whenever you stop for a respite from exploring, you can identify your new gear, reequip and restructure your team, or even upgrade your characters' classes along branching paths!<br><br><strong>Explore the Dungeon!</strong><br>The Auto-Map function will fill in the grid with each step, letting you know where you are and where you've been. Be careful, though! Don't try to go too far at once...<br><br><strong>Battle &amp; Collect Monsters!</strong><br>The deeper you delve into the dungeon, the more dangerous the monsters will become. You'll need tactics to counter each new threat—and what better way to get to know your foes than by weakening them and sealing them into your book for study? <br><br><strong>Strategize and Win!</strong><br>With every battle you'll amass more gold, EXP, and items. It's up to you whether to press on, or to head back outside to power up for later!<br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br>When I awoke, there was fantasy stuff everywhere⸺<br>What kind of adventure could be in store?

A bright flash filled the room...<br>When Takaaki opened his eyes, he was somewhere he didn't recognize.<br>His friends Konomi and Tamaki were kitted out in full fantasy gear, and when he looked more closely, he realized he was too.<br><br>Were they in the game?

            "about_the_game": "Recruit a huge cast of friends from four different base classes that branch into over a dozen variations, and always build the best party for the job! Explore one long, twisting dungeon that only gets more perilous the further you go, with plenty of optional quests and side areas to unlock! The original Dungeon Travelers game takes place in a separate world from the others, drawing characters instead from the fan-beloved world of the PS2 anime classic <i><strong>To Heart 2</strong></i>.<br><br><strong>Prepare at the Guild!</strong><br>Whenever you stop for a respite from exploring, you can identify your new gear, reequip and restructure your team, or even upgrade your characters' classes along branching paths!<br><br><strong>Explore the Dungeon!</strong><br>The Auto-Map function will fill in the grid with each step, letting you know where you are and where you've been. Be careful, though! Don't try to go too far at once...<br><br><strong>Battle &amp; Collect Monsters!</strong><br>The deeper you delve into the dungeon, the more dangerous the monsters will become. You'll need tactics to counter each new threat—and what better way to get to know your foes than by weakening them and sealing them into your book for study? <br><br><strong>Strategize and Win!</strong><br>With every battle you'll amass more gold, EXP, and items. It's up to you whether to press on, or to head back outside to power up for later!<br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br>When I awoke, there was fantasy stuff everywhere⸺<br>What kind of adventure could be in store? And will there be any way home when it's all said and done?!<br><br>It all started after class in the student council room.<br>Takaaki and all his friends had been gathered to test some unquestionably suspicious if not downright dangerous game—or &quot;full-body immersive RPG experience,&quot; in the words of its inimitable creator Ma-ryan.<br>The play-test was only questionably voluntary.<br><br>The game started to launch. A bright flash filled the room...<br>When Takaaki opened his eyes, he was somewhere he didn't recognize.<br>His friends Konomi and Tamaki were kitted out in full fantasy gear, and when he looked more closely, he realized he was too.<br><br>Were they in the game? Forget that—how would they get out?<br>Only one lead presented itself. &quot;In the depths of the dungeon located nearby, there lives the god who created this world...&quot;<br>But who could it be?<br><br>In search of more clues and hopefully some answers, the party set out into the dungeon...<br><br><strong>CHARACTERS</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1901620/extras/このみ_英語.png?t=1732445233\" /><br><br>Konomi Yuzuhara (Voice: Yurina Hase)<br>Takaaki's childhood friend, one year younger, who lives next door.<br>She's fond of fortune-telling and food and has a dog named Genjimaru.<br>Likes to look after people but isn't much good at it.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1901620/extras/タマ姉_英.png?t=1732445233\" /><br><br>Tamaki Kousaka (Voice: Shizuka Ito)<br>One year older than Takaaki and Konomi, she was always the boss of their motley crew.<br>The heiress of an old family, skilled at cooking, cleaning, martial arts, and academia. <br>Her hobbies include antiques collecting and historical dramas.

If you are ambushed, you will lose all the materials. The collected materials can also be used to create more powerful weapons, so that you can kill all sides in the next battle. Therefore, when escaping, you need to solve the enemies as much as possible to obtain more materials. At the same time, the game also has three modes of play: Normal,Endless Parkour, and Chicken Dinner. Although they are all completely different ways of playing, you can also experience the tense and exciting escape action.<br />\r\n1. Normal: The main gameplay of the game, collect materials, and then use the collected materials to upgrade weapons, but all equipment will be lost if you die in this mode.<br />\r\n2. Endless Parkour: A casual gameplay, which is currently being developed and improved. In this mode, players will keep rushing forward and need to kill the enemies blocking the front. If they collide with the enemy, the player will lose life.<br />\r\n3. Chicken Dinner: A huge electric grid surrounds the players. Players do not have any weapons and equipment at the beginning. They need to collect materials while being careful of the opponent's ambush. After killing the opponent, they can upgrade and randomly obtain a magic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the three game modes, we also have a large number of skins, pets and other systems.

Then just switch to the right side and fight against the AI-controlled left side.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ridiculously Strong AI</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The AI in 《The Immortal Scripture》 uses the latest reinforcement learning algorithms. After long periods of training and fine-tuning, it ensures that every level is a challenge that even the author can easily lose to. The goal is to provide players with a refreshing and engaging gaming experience.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Beyond Balance</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each level in《The Immortal Scripture》 has undergone repeated calculations to ensure the overall strength is evenly matched on both sides. Additionally, it ensures that each character's card abilities are neither overly strong nor overly weak.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Author is a Good Person</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To help players clear the game, at the very beginning, the author offers a sacrifice feature. By sacrificing your subjects, you can directly alter the stats of the characters on the board, making it easier to clear the level. Hopefully, this will help you progress!</p>",
