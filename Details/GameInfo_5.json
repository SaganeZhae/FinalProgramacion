It sold more than a million copies and earned its spot in the top-5 best-selling Intellivision® games ever. In this space-themed game, players use a laser cannon to destroy incoming meteors, bombs, and other targets. <br><br>In ASTROSMASH® you control a laser cannon that scrolls left or right along a flat plane to target falling objects, such as large or small meteors, spinning bombs, guided missiles, or an UFO that crosses the screen from time to time at higher levels.

As the game advances, the range of speed increases.<br><br>The game has ten levels, each of which features different objects.

The hyperspace option moves the laser cannon to a random location, which may or may not be safer than the starting point. <br><br>This <strong>ASTROSMASH® </strong>reincarnation is much more exciting, more visually appealing, and somewhat more challenging without straying from the game’s original theme and gameplay. The new graphics are phenomenal and the amazing background music – compiled by the famous game music composer Tommy Tallarico – adds incredible excitement to this video game classic. Plus, <strong>ASTROSMASH®</strong> now enables players to co-operate or play against each other; locally or online – even across platforms - for up to four players.<br><br>In addition you are also able to play the old original Intellivision® <strong>ASTROSMASH®</strong> from 1981.

They call you the Observer for a Good Reason. You Observe a Home of People who were evacuated a long time ago. Your Instructor says that you need to find anomalies and Report them. But in addition, you are an Operator. So you need to assign certain Special Task Forces to the Anomalys which then will be removed. But the Anomalies get stronger every Shift.
